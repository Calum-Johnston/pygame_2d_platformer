Player will move to top of platform on collision
Player too big

ERROR!!! Distance to nearest platform increases gradually over time with random code
FIXED:
- For inbuilt levels, distanceToNextBuild = distance between first new built plat (off-screen)
  and final new built plat (off-screen)
- For randomised levels, distanceToNextBuild = distance between highest plat (on-screen) and
  final new built plat (off-screen)
Because of this, the camera would have to move a little further each time before generating
new platforms, and eventually it wouldn't generate them within range.

Possbily implement equation to calculate max jump height (for platform gen.)
Issue here - To do with checking for collision and resetting y value

Still to do:
- Add enemy, that shoots missles at you (tracks you) - hit by enemy you die
- Add ability to shoot back at missles
- Add moving platforms
- Add scoring to the game
- Make platforms more difficult as score increases
- Build some pre-built challenge parts (more mobs, hard jumps, etc)
- Textures for players, platforms, enemies and more
- Create proper start/end screens
- General improvements to code, design, layout
