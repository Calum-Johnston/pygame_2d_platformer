Still to do:
- Mess around with game settings
- General improvements to code, design, layout!!!


Could do, but don't have to:
- Improve moving off the screen
- Make scaling automatic (for loading in images)
- Make it so it works for any size screen
- Build some pre-built challenge parts (more mobs, hard jumps, etc)
- Add platform you cannot jump through (only for challenge sections)
- Add sound


Not issues but interesting:
- Not sure why both distanceToNextBuild in buildRandomPlatforms() works
- Not sure why self.position.y - 2 in update() works
- if(self.platform.rect.bottom > self.rect.bottom):  PRODUCES error because
  position is updated and then it is calculated
