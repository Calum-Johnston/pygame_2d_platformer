Still to do:
- Collisions between player and projectiles
- Change enemy spawn, flag spawn, platform spawn, etc
- Make platforms more difficult as score increases (more moving, faster moving, greater distance, etc)
- Build some pre-built challenge parts (more mobs, hard jumps, etc)


MAKE TICK COUNT A THING IN PLAYER

Could do, but don't have to:
- Add special abilities
- Improve moving off the screen
- Implement equation to calculate max jump height (for platform gen.) (Issue here - To do with checking for collision and resetting y value)
- Make scaling automatic (for loading in images)
- Make it so it works for any size screen
- General improvements to code, design, layout!!!


Not issues but interesting:
- Not sure why both distanceToNextBuild in buildRandomPlatforms() works
- Not sure why self.position.y - 2 in update() works
- if(self.platform.rect.bottom > self.rect.bottom):  PRODUCES error because
  position is updated and then it is calculated
