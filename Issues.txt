Player will move to top of platform on collision
Player too big

ERROR!!! Distance to nearest platform increases gradually over time with random code
FIXED:
- For inbuilt levels, distanceToNextBuild = distance between first new built plat (off-screen)
  and final new built plat (off-screen)
- For randomised levels, distanceToNextBuild = distance between highest plat (on-screen) and
  final new built plat (off-screen)
Because of this, the camera would have to move a little further each time before generating
new platforms, and eventually it wouldn't generate them within range.

Possbily implement equation to calculate max jump height (for platform gen.)
Issue here - To do with checking for collision and resetting y value
